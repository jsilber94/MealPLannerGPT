  "ingredient_prompts": "The ingredients must be based on the meal plan for lunch and dinner. The list should be something that a person can take to the grocery store. Measurements should be in metric not imperial. The family should be able to use all the ingredients to make the meals. Take into account the caloric requirements for adults and children. The products must include the amounts. Good examples of this are as follows: 3 peppers, 500g of chicken breast, one jar of sauce, one can of diced tomatoes. Every ingredient should have an amount. Vegetables should be in units so 4 lemons and not pack. Make sure you provide all the necessary ingredients for a meal. Greek salad requires tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cucumber, feta cheese, olive oil. Make sure not to include $allergies or $disliked_food in any capacity. Find alternative ingredients for the previously mentioned banned ingredients. All the ingredients should be specific. Roasted vegetables is not specific enough for an ingredient. None of the ingredients should be $allergies or $disliked_food. An example is to not include red onions or onion powder if the banned ingredient is an onion. Differentiate the ingredients by meal. Think step by step in order to include all specifications. Generate a list of ingredients based on the list of lunch and dinner meals while taking all previous rules into account, especially banned foods.",
